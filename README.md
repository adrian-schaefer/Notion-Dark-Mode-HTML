# Notion-Dark-Mode-HTML
Bash script that converts all html pages within a directory to dark mode.  
This is a very simple script I made for personal use and I have decided to publish it in case it can help anyone.  

### Recommended Notion Settings for Export

I recommend not ticking the "Create folders for subpages" box. When there are many subdirectories the extension of the files may be affected and errors may occur.

### Usage
chmod +x darkhtml.sh  
./darkhtml.sh Directory
